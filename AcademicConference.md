## The Chronicle

## Structure

---

## Our Approach

- Digital, diplomatic edition
- Started with Book 3
- Used XML to edit table of contents and accompanying text

---

## Choosing Our Scope of Research

- Previous research on manuscripts of Chronicle of St. Jerome
- Began with first Olympiad within texts for both projects
- Comparing texts to look for differences related to time and probable sources used

---

## Table of contents

- Organization from table of contents not entirely reflected within history
- Example of Romulus and Remus
- Otherwise follows closely

## Portrayal of Dates

- Less commitment to mission as historian
- Insight into genre
- Passage of time between the first Olympiad and Fall of Troy

## Use of Outside Sources

- Later hand refers to another source
- "Haec sunt transposita"
- "These things are moved"

## Insight into Audience

- Jerome: Writing for audience in Roman Empire:
    - Geneva 49 has 5 French references
    - St. Gallen has 0
- Fredegarius: Writing for a French audience
    - Bern 318 has 7 French references

## Ensuing Questions

- Why are there on the margins?
- How do we reconcile Fredegarius’ Latin-French mixture of languages?
- Why does Fredegarius change some of Jerome’s dates?
