## Structure

## Our Approach

- Started with Book 3
- Used XML to edit table of contents and accompanying text

---

## Choosing Our Scope of Research

- Previous research on manuscripts of Chronicle of St. Jerome
- Began with first Olympiad within texts for both projects
- Comparing texts to look for differences related to time and probable sources used

---

## Comparing Table of Contents with His Discussion and Jerome

- Organization from Table of Contents not entirely reflected within history
- Example of Romulus and Remus
- Otherwise follows closely

## Insight into Audience 

- Jerome: Writing on behalf of Roman Empire
- Geneva 49 has five French references, St. Gallen has 0
- Fredegarius: Writing for a French audience
- Bern 318 has 7 French references

- Greek φ on the side of the page with nothing surrounding it

![Phi full view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HCMID/fredegarius/master/Section%2062r%20full%20page%20view.png)
- Greek φ on the side of the page perhaps written in a different hand with nothing surrounding it

## Ensuing Questions

- Why are there on the margins?
- How do we reconcile Fredegarius’ Latin-French mixture of languages?
- Why does Fredegarius change some of Jerome’s dates?
